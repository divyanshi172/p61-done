<!-- Specifies the HTML Version: It tells 
the web browser that the document 
is an HTML5 document. HTML5 is the
 latest and most widely used version of HTML.
 Can other languages be used here?

Absolutely, yes! In fact, it's highly recommended to use the correct language code for your content.

You use standard ISO 639-1 language codes (two-letter codes) or BCP 47 language tags (which can include region codes, scripts, etc., for more specificity).

Examples of other languages and their lang attributes:

French: <html lang="fr">

Spanish: <html lang="es">

German: <html lang="de">

Hindi: 

Chinese (Simplified): <html lang="zh-Hans">

Japanese: <html lang="ja">

Arabic: <html lang="ar">

Portuguese (Brazil): <html lang="pt-BR"> (This uses a subtag for regional variations)

English (United Kingdom): <html lang="en-GB">

Important Considerations:

Primary Langu -->
<!-- UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit): This is the specific character encoding being declared.
charset attribute: This attribute specifies the character encoding for the document.
meta tag: This tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata is data about data â€“ in this case, it gives information about the HTML page itself, rather than content that is displayed on the page.

width=device-width: This sets the width of the viewport (the visible area of the webpage) to the width of the device's screen. So, on a phone, the webpage will try to use the full width of the phone's screen.

initial-scale=1.0: This sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded. A value of 1.0 means there's no zoom, and the page is displayed at its actual size.
